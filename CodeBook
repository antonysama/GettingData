"Activity" & "Subject" - The fist couple variables in the clean data set are as described in the features text & the assignment
  - The 6 "Activity" fields are as described in the activity labels text file

The balance 79 variables are a SUBSET limited to the Mean & Standard Deviation from ~ 550 variables described in features or "x" text files.
  - Terms include: 
      - acceleration-body linear acceleration and 
      - angular velocity-body 
      - transformation- f or Fourier transofrmation
      - magnitude-magnitude of the three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
      - Jerk signal- Jerk signal of body signals

The R script refers to 6 of those provided in the assignment dataset, plus some that were created in the process:
  -x_test - variables of the test dataset
  -x - training- variables of the training dataset
  -y_test - activities of the test dataset
  -y_training - activites of the training dataset
  -s_test - subjects of the test dataset
  -s_training - subjects of the training dataset
  -c -list of 79 labels that are a SUBSET limited to the Mean & Standard Deviation from ~ 550 variables described in features
  -x_testc -79 variables that are a SUBSET limited to the Mean & Standard Deviation, part of the test set
  -n -same as c in this thread above
  -l -list used as a first step to merging the new x_test & x_training data tables
  -m -the new merged data table
  -e -the final clean data table
